* Figure 1: Schematic illustration of experiment 2. Focal individuals are square-shaped, with their respective pool of social teachers with same color. The green dots represent the shared portion of the pool, whilst the grey dots represent individuals outside the pool (N=1000, k=100).
 
* Figure 2: Probability of Loss as a function of k for different models of social learning: a) without convergent innovation; b)with convergent innovation (c=0.005). In all cases g_i=3 and g_j=1. Probabilities obtained from 10,000 simulations for each value of k.
